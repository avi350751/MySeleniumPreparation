# Project Overview

This project contains automated test scripts developed using Selenium WebDriver with Java in Eclipse IDE. The primary goal of this project is to automate functional and regression testing of web applications, ensuring consistent and efficient test coverage.

## Technologies & Tools Used

Programming Language: Java

Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver

IDE: Eclipse IDE

Build Tool: Maven (or Gradle if applicable)

Test Framework: TestNG (or JUnit)

Browser Drivers: ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver (Firefox), EdgeDriver, etc.

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Dependency Management: Maven Central Repository

Reporting: Extent Reports / Allure Reports (if integrated)

Others: Log4j (for logging), Apache POI (for Excel file handling), etc.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Java JDK 8 or above

Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

Maven (if using Maven)

Git (for version control)

Chrome / Firefox / Edge browsers with corresponding drivers

Internet connection to download dependencies

## Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Import project in Eclipse:

Open Eclipse IDE

Go to File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects

Select the cloned project directory

Download browser drivers:

Download ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, EdgeDriver, etc., and place them inside the drivers/ folder.

Configure drivers path in your code if not automatically handled.

Update dependencies:

mvn clean install

Running the Tests

Using Eclipse:

Right click on the test class or test suite > Run As > TestNG Test (or JUnit Test)

Using Maven:

mvn clean test

Test Results:

Test reports will be generated inside the reports/ directory.

Sample Test Flow

Launch browser.

Navigate to the target URL.

Perform functional validations.

Capture logs, screenshots on failure (if implemented).

Close the browser.

Key Features

Cross-browser testing support

Data-driven testing using Excel files

TestNG based test execution and parallel runs

Extent or Allure reporting integration (if applicable)

Page Object Model (POM) design pattern (if implemented)

Logging using Log4j

Common Issues & Solutions

Browser driver compatibility: Ensure browser version matches driver version.

Network issues while downloading Maven dependencies: Retry with a stable internet connection.

Eclipse build issues: Clean and rebuild the project (Project > Clean in Eclipse).
